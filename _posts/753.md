## Part 4: Designs and Declarations

[Item 20: Prefer pass-by-reference-to-const to pass-by-value](http://www.yekezhong.com/753 "Item 20: Prefer pass-by-reference-to-const to pass-by-value").

* * *

## Things to remember

*   Prefer pass-by-value-to-const over pass-by-value. It's typically more efficient and it avoids the slicing problem.
*   The rule doesn't apply to build-in types and[ STL iterator](http://www.yekezhong.com/574 "Iterator 简单实现") and function object types. For them, pass by value is usually appropriate.
*   对于正常的 [C++](http://www.yekezhong.com/cpp "Category Archives: C++") 程序，传值的地方传 [const](http://www.yekezhong.com/574 "关于const成员函数的使用") 引用总是没错的。对象复制不仅成本太高，正确实现对象复制也不是件容易的事。如果想把对象置入一个[容器](http://www.yekezhong.com/574 "用allocator实现的标准库vector容器类模版")，最好是使用它的引用。

## Key words

## **[Copy-On-Write](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write "Copy-on-write wikipedia") (COW)：**

copy-on-write is the name give to the process of identifying when a task attempts to make a change to shared information, creating a separate(private) copy of that information for the task and redirecting the task to making changes to the private copy to prevent its changes from becoming visible to all other tasks.

**[Slicing Problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/274626/what-is-the-slicing-problem-in-c "What is the slicing problem in C++?")：**

"Slicing" is where you assign an object of a derived class to an instance of a base class, thereby losing part of the information - some of it is "sliced" away.

### Code

``` c++
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::string;

class Person {
public:
	Person(string name, string address): name(name), address(address) { }
private:
	string name;
	string address;
};

class Student : public Person {
public:
	Student(string name, string address, string schoolName, string schoolAddress) \
		: Person(name, address), schoolName(schoolName), schoolAddress(schoolAddress) { }
private:
	string schoolName;
	string schoolAddress;
};

bool validateStudent(Student s)
{
	return true; // test
}
bool validateStudent2(const Student& s)
{
	return true;
}

int main()
{
	Student plato("plato", "Athens", "Socrates", "Athens");
	// the overall cost of passing a Student by value is six constructors
	// and six destructors!
	bool platoIsOK = validateStudent(plato);
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}
```
